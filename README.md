# Simplified JavaScript Jargon

*Simplified JavaScript Jargon* (short *SJSJ*) is a community-driven attempt at explaining the loads of buzzwords making the current JavaScript ecosystem in a few simple words. The idea is not to replace individual documentations, but to act as some kind of glossary that can be easily referrenced.

## AngularJS

[AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) is a structural framework for dynamic web apps. It lets developers use HTML as their template language and lets them extend HTML’s syntax to express their application’s components clearly and succinctly.

Angular’s data binding and dependency injection eliminate much of the code developers would otherwise have to write. And it all happens within the browser, making it an ideal partner with any server technology.

## Babel

[Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (formerly *6to5*) is essentially an [ECMAScript](#ecmascript-es) 6 and beyond transpiler. It means that it is a program that translates future’s JavaScript into today’s widely understood (by browsers) JavaScript. The idea behind such a tool is to allow developers to write their code using ECMAScript new features while still making it work in current browsers (and past) browsers.

As of version 6, Babel also intends to be a platform, a suite of tools designed to create the next generation of JavaScript tooling. This means Babel is also supposed to power minifiers, linters, formatters, syntax highlighters, code completion tools, type checkers, codemod tools, and every other tool to be using the same foundation to do their job better than ever before.

## Backbone

[Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) section to be completed.

## Bower

[Bower](http://bower.io/) is a package manager for front-end dependencies. It takes care of hunting, finding, downloading, saving these dependencies and keeping track of them in a manifest file called `bower.json`. Bower uses a flat dependency tree, requiring only one version for each package, reducing page load to a minimum.

## Broccoli

## Browserify

[Browserify](http://browserify.org/) section to be completed.

## Brunch

[Brunch](http://brunch.io/) section to be completed.

## CoffeeScript

[CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) is a little language that compiles into JavaScript. It is an attempt to expose the good parts of JavaScript in a simple way and friendly syntax, the golden rule being: “It’s just JavaScript”.

The code compiles one-to-one into the equivalent JS, and there is no interpretation at runtime. The compiled output is readable and pretty-printed, will work in every JavaScript runtime, and tends to run as fast or faster than the equivalent handwritten JavaScript.

## ECMAScript (ES)

[ECMAScript](http://www.ecmascript.org/) (shortened as *ES*) is the standardized specification of the scripting language used by JavaScript, as well as less known languages JScript and ActionScript.

The versioning convention of ECMAScript has been the subject of hot debates. We often refer to ES5 (understood by most browsers), ES6 (the future of JavaScript) and even ES7 (the far future of JavaScript), but the official appelation for ES6 would actually be ES2015. The intention is to publish a version of the specification a year, making the language evolve quicker than ever. Still, most developers use ES5 and ES6 terms.

## Ember

## Express

## Grunt

## Gulp

## io.js

[io.js](https://iojs.org/en/) section to be completed.

## jQuery

[jQuery](https://jquery.com/) is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript.

## Knockout

[Knockout](https://jquery.com/) section to be completed.

## Meteor

[Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) section to be completed.

## MooTools

[MooTools](http://mootools.net/) section to be completed.

## Node.js

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment for developing server-side web applications built on Chrome’s [V8](#v8) JavaScript engine. These applications are written in JavaScript and can be run within the Node.js runtime.

Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O (input/output) model that makes it lightweight and efficient as well as optimized for real-time web applications’ throughput and scalability.

Its work is hosted and supported by the [Node.js Foundation](https://nodejs.org/en/foundation/), a collaborative project at Linux Foundation.

## Yeoman

[Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) is both a generator builder and an ecosystem. A generator is basically a plugin that can be run with the `yo` command to scaffold complete projects or useful parts.

Therefore, the goal of a Yeoman generator is usually (but not necessarily) to speed up the setup and installation process of a project or part of a project by packaging it inside a module that can be configured through a question/reply workflow from the command line.

## V8

[V8](https://code.google.com/p/v8/) section to be completed.

## Webpack

[Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) helps you managing dependencies in your project, and also offers a friendly and fast development environment, simplifying a lot of common tasks behind a simple configuration file. It also allows you to bundle your modules into static assets for browsers. Its killer feature is the known as [hot module replacement](https://github.com/webpack/docs/wiki/hot-module-replacement-with-webpack), which lets your live code in the browser update automatically as you change files in your preferred editor without a page reload.
