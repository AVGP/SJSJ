# Promise

A *Promise* represents a value that may not be available yet but will eventually be resolved at some point. The point is to allow developers to write asynchronous code in a more synchronous fashion, escaping from the popular [callback hell](http://callbackhell.com/).

Promises are not fully supported in all browsers yet (see [support](http://caniuse.com/#feat=promises)), however a lot of libraries mimick their behaviour to make them usable right away; [Bluebird](/BLUEBIRD.md) is one of them.
