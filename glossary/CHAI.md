# Chai

[Chai](http://chaijs.com/) is a BDD/TDD assertion library for Node and the browser. It can be paired with any JavaScript testing framework, such as Mocha.

The Chai assertion library allows you to write assertions in a classical form `assert.typeOf(foo, 'string')`, but what makes Chai shine is its chain-capable style which makes writing assertions very readable `expect(foo).to.be.a('string')`.
