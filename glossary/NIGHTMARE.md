# Nightmare

[Nightmare](http://nightmarejs.org/) is a high-level browser automation library.

The goal is to expose just a few simple methods, and have an API that feels synchronous for each block of scripting, rather than deeply nested callbacks. It's designed for automating tasks across sites that don't have APIs.

Under the covers it uses [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/), which is similar to [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) but faster and more modern.
