# Underscore

[Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/) is a small (5.7kb) library, which provides many helpers to write JS in a more functional way without extending build-in objects. It may be seen as the swiss army knife of JS development, as it provides a helper for most API shortcomings of the build-in objects.
